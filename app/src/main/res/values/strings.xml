    <string name="description">The underperformed teams in the IPL history, Kings XI Punjab and the Delhi Capitals began the 2019 edition on a positive note. Both the teams won their respective first matches but lost the second game. They bounced back with victories during the doubleheader on Saturday. The Kings XI has had moments of controversies in the three matches in this edition. The Capitals, on the other hand, stopped the Kolkata Knight Riders’ winning run in a game that went down to the Super Over.</string>

    <string name="description_3">Highlights: Shane Watson and Suresh Raina made batting look easy on a lifeless track as Chennai Super Kings coasted to a six-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals in an Indian Premier League encounter in New Delhi on Tuesday. Shikhar Dhawan’s painstaking half-century was the only silver lining in Delhi Capitals’ sub-par total of 147 for six which the defending champions overtook with two balls to spare. The scoreline might suggest that it was a close game but CSK were always in control of the chase despite a lot of balls being wasted by Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the back end of the innings.</string>
